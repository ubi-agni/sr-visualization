    <description>
      A GUI plugin for a more advanced way of loading the different motor controllers. It allows to load the desired type of controllers for all the
      joints in the Shadow Robot Hand (all the same type).
      The plugin does not read the current state of the controllers, so if the controllers are loaded from outside the
      plugin, the initial state
      of the plugin will be inconsistent with the state of the controllers. The Stop button stops all the currently
      running controllers, even if
      different types of controllers are running for the different joints.
